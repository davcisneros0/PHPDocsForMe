# PHPDocsForMe
relearning PHP, just adding all my notes and stuff I have learned on here.

# ARRAYS
- Use a Foreach loop to go through each item (numbers, items) in an array foreach($books as $book) {}

# ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS
- arrays that that use named keys that you assign to them

# FUNCTIONS/FILTERS
- = sign to assign a value
- === to check equality
- Functions are the verbs of the programming world
- Default parameters can be done with functions, such as function setHeight($minheight = 50) {}
- To accept an UNKNOWN number of arguments in a function, you can use the ... operatora
    - It must be the LAST argument
